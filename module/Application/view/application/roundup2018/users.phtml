    <p>Content of this page is focused on the changes that happened to the population of the wiki in 2018. We examine new members and the ways they participated in the life of the wiki. We attempt to present data in a way that reveals trends concerning rates of joining as well as user retention. Much of this post deals with timespans during which users were active on the wiki.</p>
    <p>Most of the data will be presented in the form of tables and charts. Charts are interactive: hover mouse cursor over the elements of a chart to see detailed hints and left click to select those elements. Many charts support zoom: press left mouse button and drag cursor over a chart to select an area for zoom-in. Click right mouse button to reset chart to its default scale.</p>
    <p>Finally, we would like to note that it is not the purpose of this work to perform conclusive analysis of presented data and establish aforementioned trends and dependencies beyond a shadow of a doubt. Rather we aim to present data in an easily digestible way, add some thoughts of our own and leave conclusions to the reader.</p>

    <p>
        In 2018 at least <strong><?php echo number_format($this->total[0]['Count']); ?></strong> users joined the wiki. Please, note that for the technical reasons this number does not include users who have been since banned or left the wiki on their own volition, so the actual influx was even higher. To put this number into context, in 2017 the wiki grew by <strong><?php echo number_format(11160); ?></strong> users making this growth over <strong>142%</strong> year of year, at least nominally. The number for 2016 was <strong><?php echo number_format(6962); ?></strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Raw numbers suggest that wiki is growing faster than ever, but these numbers may be misleading as not all users actually participate in the life of wiki. In the following material we will examine how rate of joining depends on a day or time of day. Unfortunately, approval process remains manual so it doesn't tell us much other than times when admins are active.

        Normally ScpperDB shows dates and times at GMT+0:00, but for the roundup all times and dates were converted to US Central Standard Time, or more precisely to GMT-6:00, as this conversion does not account for daylight saving time.

        One interesting oddity in this chart is the sudden drop in June. Perhaps, an effect of summer break or year finals.

        Not much to say here, rate of admission throughout the week fluctuates between ~1600 on Monday and ~2900 on Saturday. Like we noted before this speaks more to the availability of admins rather than the rate of applications.

<h4 class="roundup-section-title">Activity</h4>
<div class="roundup-pages-box-bounds roundup-comment">
    <p>
        In this section we will examine what new users did with their time on the wiki. Activity in ScpperDB's terms is one of the following: voting on pages, editing pages or posting new pages. Posting on forum, as helpful and productive as it can be does not count.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2018 out of <strong><?php echo number_format($this->total[0]['Count']); ?></strong> newcomers <strong><?php echo number_format($this->roles['inactive'][0]['Count']); ?></strong> never engaged in any sort of activity. <strong><?php echo number_format($this->roles['voters'][0]['Count']); ?></strong> voted on pages that weren't their own. <strong><?php echo number_format($this->roles['editors'][0]['Count']); ?></strong> edited at least one page that they did not author. <strong><?php echo number_format($this->roles['posters'][0]['Count']); ?></strong> tried their hand at writing an article and <strong><?php echo number_format($this->roles['authors'][0]['Count']); ?></strong> succeeded.
    </p>    
    <p>
        Normally ScpperDB considers a user to be active if they engaged in at least one activity in the past 6 months. For the purpose of this page we cut this period down to 3 months. So, for example, a user casted a vote on July, 6th and then haven't done shit for the next 3 months. On any given day during these 3 months they counts as active. On October, 7th, however, they stop being active and don't regain this status until they either post a page, edit one or vote.

        To little surprise most of aspiring authors - <strong>60%</strong> to be precise, submit their first page in their first week, <strong>45%</strong> in the first three days, <strong>21%</strong> immediately after joining. We should note that the data in this chart is somewhat skewed towards the start as at the time of writing the number of users who had been members for several months was lower that the number of users who had been members for a week or less.

        After looking at the preceding chart and remembering all the coldposts one could surmise that most successful pages are posted after a significant period of critiquing, editing and rewriting. As we see from this chart, most successful pages are posted in the first week or two. Intuitively, this would mean that success of the first article has little correlation with the age of an account.

        Normally, failing and learning from mistakes is an integral part of any self-improvement. However, in this case the vast majority, over <strong>83%</strong> of eventually successful authors achieve it on their first try. In other words, out of <strong><?php echo number_format($this->roles['posters'][0]['Count']); ?></strong> posters <strong><?php echo number_format($this->postsToSuccess[0]['Count']); ?></strong> get it right off the bat, making success rate of the first post <strong><?php printf("%.1f%%", $this->postsToSuccess[0]['Count']/$this->roles['posters'][0]['Count']*100); ?></strong>. Of the rest <strong><?php echo number_format($this->roles['posters'][0]['Count']-$this->postsToSuccess[0]['Count']); ?></strong> posters only <strong><?php echo number_format($this->roles['authors'][0]['Count']-$this->postsToSuccess[0]['Count']); ?></strong> (or <strong><?php printf("%.1f%%", ($this->roles['authors'][0]['Count']-$this->postsToSuccess[0]['Count'])/($this->roles['posters'][0]['Count']-$this->postsToSuccess[0]['Count'])*100); ?></strong>) ever manage to write a passable article. We conclude that it's a tough living out there.

        Similarly to the previous chart this one shows how long users stick around after their first successful article. Less than <strong>2%</strong> of new users become authors, but this chart is intended to show retention levels among these few. Right off the bat we can see that the curve here is much more gradual.
    </p>
    <p>
        Speaking in terms of raw numbers <strong><?php echo number_format($this->roles['authors'][0]['Count']); ?></strong> new users succeeded in writing for the wiki and out of them <strong><?php echo number_format($this->stillActiveAfterSuccess[0]['Count']); ?></strong> are still active at the time of writing.

        In this chart we can see how length of a period of activity is distributed among all users who had joined in 2018 and fallen inactive since. Users who never became active in the first place aren't included in the dataset. Period of activity is counted as a number of days between joining and user's last recorded activity. As the chart demonstrates the peak falls on mere <strong>1-2 days</strong>, then numbers keep falling until <strong>9-10 days</strong> after which rate of inactivity more or less stabilizes. Indeed, out of <strong><?php echo $this->stillActive[0]['WereActive']; ?></strong> active users who joined in the first 9 months of the year <strong>1581 (over 28%)</strong> never did anything after their first week.

        In the first half of 2018 the wiki was enjoying steady growth in terms of active users. Active population plateaued around mid June, which more or less corresponds with decline in applications we've observed in the first chart. Despite the fact that nominal population of the wiki resumed its growth in July, the number of active users have stayed at the same level. Still, this is over <strong>60%</strong> growth over six months.

            This wouldn't be a proper yearly roundup without some top-X lists. In this section we will try to give appropriate recognition to at least some of the people who have made significant contributions to the wiki in 2018. Only users who have made their first successful post in 2018 were considered for this section, even if they joined in the previous years.

            To cover the most proverbial ground the section is divided into three categories: total rating (combined rating of all authored pages), number of authored pages, and highest rated page. Again, for technical reasons users who have been banned or left the wiki did not qualify for this section.
